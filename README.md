# CoStar Data Science Internship Take Home Assignment
CoStar Take Home Assignment

This is an interactive dashboard to demonstrate my vision for my project proposal. This project proposal is aimed at creating a systematic way to genearte Listing Quality Scores for listings on the BizBuySell.com website to optimize sort order of listings and increase number of leads on listings. 

The dashboard allows you to 
- Filter by category
- Set the minimum LQS of listings visible to you
- Set the minimum Days Active of listings visible to you
- Provides visualizations and scatterplots and histograms to analyze LQS against different features

Please keep in mind that this is a prototype for demonstration purposes, and when creating an actual dashboard or ML pipeline, the data and format will look very different.

Hope this is helpful! If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at kelly8hu@berkeley.edu
